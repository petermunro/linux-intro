# Linux Fundamentals

Linux is used by many large websites - Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo,
Amazon, YouTube, and more. Have you wondered why? Learn the
fundamentals of how to harness Linux\'s power in this engaging course,
which is intended for those who want to get the most out of using Linux.

I place particular emphasis on the simple yet general concepts
underlying Linux. These concepts enable you to do very powerful things.
You will learn:

1.  how Linux\'s very simple structure gives you great flexibility
2.  how to hook commands together as \'building blocks\' to make more
    powerful commands
3.  the common features the \'shell\' gives you that can be used with
    any command
4.  how to process files and text

# Approach

The course is part lecture, part hands-on.

# Prerequisites

Delegates must have familiarity in using computer systems such as
Windows or Mac OS X.

# Duration

5 days

# Equipment

The course may be run either:

1.  Using 'blank' PCs on which Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS is
    installed; or
2.  On Windows, using Virtual Machine software.

# Objectives

On completion of this course, you will:

- Understand the structure of a Linux system
- Be able to navigate around a Linux system
